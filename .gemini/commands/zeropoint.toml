# Zero-Point Agent Bootstrap

You are helping to set up the zero-point agent rules and workflows in this project.

## Current Status
The following commands were executed to sync the zero-point configuration:

!{bash -c '
set -e
ZERO_POINT_DIR="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/zero-point-cache"

# Clone or update zero-point repo
if [ -d "$ZERO_POINT_DIR" ]; then
  echo "Updating zero-point cache..."
  cd "$ZERO_POINT_DIR" && git pull --quiet origin main
else
  echo "Cloning zero-point repo..."
  git clone --quiet https://github.com/dgulli/zero-point.git "$ZERO_POINT_DIR"
fi

# Create .agent directory if needed
mkdir -p .agent

# Copy rules and workflows
echo "Copying .agent/rules..."
cp -r "$ZERO_POINT_DIR/.agent/rules" .agent/

echo "Copying .agent/workflows..."
cp -r "$ZERO_POINT_DIR/.agent/workflows" .agent/

echo ""
echo "✅ Successfully synced zero-point configuration!"
echo "Files copied to: $(pwd)/.agent/"
ls -la .agent/
'}

## Next Steps
Please inform the user:
1. The zero-point rules and workflows have been copied to `.agent/` in their project
2. They can customize these files for their project
3. If they want to contribute changes back to zero-point, they should fork the repo and submit a PR

If there were any errors above, help the user troubleshoot.
